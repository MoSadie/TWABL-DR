## On Seasons:
- Season name revealed: {% include spoiler.html text="Season of Defiance" %}
- Umbral Engrams and Umbral Energy is going away. Seasonal engrams will stay on vendor, as to not clogging inventory.
- Holding large stacks of seasonal currency is going away. Keys instead. (More of a bonus than requirement)
- Fewer, more potent seasonal upgrades (reduce the grid)

- Second Season name: {% include spoiler.html text="Season of the Deep" %}
- This season will have no grid-based vendor upgrades (same with season after this one)

- Number next to username no longer Season Pass ranks, now shows Guardian Rank.

## On Weapon Crafting:

- Less total patterns, more good random rolls, and the ability to level up and enhance certain random rolled weapons.
- You will only see red-bordered weapons for weapons you need pattern progress for.
- There will be a way (in the season after {% include spoiler.html text="(Deep)" %}) to activate deepsight on any craftable weapon you don't have the pattern for.

## On Keeping Secrets:

- Generally, more details will be shown ahead of time. (Think how Haunted was revealed day of, less like that in the future)

## On Bringing the Challenge Back to Destiny

- Abilities will be tuned, see previous blog posts. (TL;DR abilities too strong, will be tuned)
- Some mod costs are being tweaked.

- If you liked the difficulty of the Heist Battlegrounds playlist, you're going to like this:
- The same difficulty tweak will come to the Season of {% include spoiler.html text="Defiance" %}'s {% include spoiler.html text="Battleground playlist" %} and the Vanguard Ops playlist. (Though not as much in Vanguard Ops obviously.)
    - Basically adjusting how over-leveled the Guardian can be compared to enemies.
- Also will apply to Neomuna's patrol area.

- Power: Will be changed in Final Shape, but...
- After a normal power jump at the start of Lightfall, there are no plans to raise the Power or Pinnacle cap for the Season after launch ({% include spoiler.html text="Deep" %}).

## On Enriching Content

- PVP:
    - Countdown returns and a new Countdown Rush mode.
    - More labs + maps (Meltdown in second season, new Vex map in S22, Citadel returns in last season)
    - There will be three Iron Banners per Season.
    - More details in [post]({{ page.bungie_url }}).

- EXOTIC MISSION ROTATOR
    - Arrives in Season 22 (ref: 19 is Seraph)
    - Will start with Presage, Vox Obscura, and Operation: Seraph's Shield.
    - Weekly rotation.
    - More missions in the future? (Hopefully)

- Strikes
    - Lake of Shadows and Arms Dealer are being majorly reworked.
    - Exodus Crash and The Inverted Spire are getting reduced appearances in Vanguard Ops playlist and removed from Nightfall rotation. (Returns to normal when updated)
        - Still can be directly launched.
    - Current Battlegrounds (Seraph and PsiOps) will join the Vanguard Ops playlist.
    - AND some Battlegrounds will join the Nightfall rotation. (Starting with Mars Heist for launch season {% include spoiler.html text="(Defiance)" %}) 

- In future seasons: (Slow burn over the year)
    - Moving earning exotic armor back to ritual playlists. (At least for initial earning)
    - No longer asking for all three pursuit weapon ornaments for Seasonal Challenges
    - Allowing players to earn more new rewards and complete more of their weekly challenges by playing content of their choice, not just in the newest seasonal activity playlist

- Connect our Guardians:
    - Commendations will have special ones for certain modes.

- Nice Chat
    - Game-wide text chat is moving to opt-out, from opt-in.
    - There will be an opt-out setting and a temporary opt-out as well.
    - Planning to invest in more features for text chat.

- Fireteam Finder:
    - Delayed to last season of the year with the dungeon
    - They want to make sure it's good.
