(Just trying to get this pushed out asap, will edit later.)

Here's what was said:
- Season name revealed: {% include spoiler.html text="Season of Defiance" %}
- Umbrals and umbral energy is going away. Seasonal engrams will stay on vendor, so not clogging inventory.
- Holding large stacks of seasonal currency is going away. Keys instead. (More bonus than requirement)
- Fewer, more potent seasonal upgrades (reduce the grid)

- SEASON AFTER NAME: {% include spoiler.html text="Season of the Deep" %}
- This season will have no grid-based vendor upgrades (same with season after)
- Number next to username no longer Season Pass ranks, now Guardian Rank

- Weapon Crafting:
- Less total patterns, more good random rolls, and the ability to level up and enhance certain random rolled weapons.
- You will only see red-bordered weapons for weapons you need pattern progress for.
- There will be a way (in the season after {% include spoiler.html text="(Deep)" %}) to activate deepsight on any craftable weapon you don't have the pattern for.

- Generally, more details will be shown ahead of time. (Think how Haunted was revealed day of, less like that in the future)

- If you liked the difficulty of the Heist Battlegrounds playlist, you're going to like this:
- The same difficulty tweak will come to the Season of {% include spoiler.html text="Defiance" %}'s {% include spoiler.html text="Battleground playlist" %} and the Vanguard Ops playlist.
- Also will apply to Neomuna's patrol area.

- Power: Will likely be changed in Final Shape, but...
- After a normal power jump at the start of Lightfall, there are no plans to raise the Power or Pinnacle cap for the Season after launch ({% include spoiler.html text="Deep" %}).

- PVP:
- Countdown returns and Countdown Rush.
- More labs + maps
- more details in post

- EXOTIC MISSION ROTATOR
- Arrives in Season 22 (ref: 19 is Seraph)
- Will start with Presage, Vox Obscura, and Operation: Seraph's Shield.
- Weekly rotation.
- More mission in the future? (Hopefully)

- Strikes
- Lake of Shadows and Arms Dealer are being reworked.
- Exodus Crash and The Inverted Spire are getting reduced odds in Vanguard Ops and removed from Nightfall. (Returns to normal when updated)
- Current (seraph) battlegrounds will join the Vanguard Ops playlist.
- AND some battlegrounds will join the Nightfall rotation. (Mars Heist for launch season {% include spoiler.html text="(Defiance)" %})) 

- In future seasons
- moving exotic armor back to ritual playlists
- refocusing what is required of players

- connect our guardians
- Commendations will have special ones for certain modes
- planning on adding communication, esp. text chat

- Fireteam Finder delayed to Final season of the year with the dungeon
- They want to make sure it's good.
