- This week at Bungie, a lot happened.
- On Tuesday, [the Witch Queen](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/WitchQueen?ciid=50638) expansion was revealed, [Season of the Lost](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfTheLost) went live, Cross Play went live, AND [the 30th Anniversary event](https://www.bungie.net/Anniversary) was also announced for December 7th.

  - Rewards go away on Wednesday September 1st at 11:59PM Pacific.
- Into the Void:
  - Straight to Businees:
    - There will be no new darkness subclass in The Witch Queen or through year 5.
    - There are no new Stasis Fragments or Aspects in the Season of the Lost.
  - Combat Reforged:
    - Time to start teasing the new overhauled Void subclasses that launch with the Witch Queen. (Known internally as Void 3.0)
    - Later this season, around the time of the 30th anniversary event, there will be a major balancing patch involving how many one shot kill abilities are available in the Crucible, and shifting Super energy regeneration so players are rewarded for combat vs waiting for a timer.
    - Later in Year 5, they want to talk about making ammo generation more deterministic.
  - Staring out Into the Void:
    - Goals of the new Void subclass:
      - Preserve the strong existing power fantasies of Void.
      - Provide new and exciting build-crafting possibilities through the combination of Aspects and Fragments.
      - Set up a framework for the systemic integration of the damage type into the rest of the game.
    - Say the (Key) Word:
      - These are terms that will be used not only in the new Void subclass, but in other places as well.

      - Negative status effects:
        - Suppression: The target is knocked out of any active abilities and can’t activate any abilities/movement modes as long as Suppression persists. Afflicted enemy AI combatants can’t shoot their weapons.
        - Weaken: The target takes increased damage and has their movement slowed. Enemy AI combatants fire their weapons with decreased accuracy.
        - Volatile: The target is afflicted with unstable Void energy and will explode upon taking additional damage or on death.
      - Positive status effects:
        - Void Overshield – A protective barrier of Void Light which reduces damage taken from combatants.
        - Invisibility – You vanish from sight and do not appear on enemy radar.
        - Devour – You feast on the energy of your foes. Kills restore you to full health, grant grenade energy, and extend Devour.
    - Old Dogs, New Tricks:
      - Here is a preview of some of the new abilities in Void 3.0.
      - Nightstalker Hunter:
      ![Hunter](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/153/153057/JJ_Void_Hunter.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=2985911544)
        - Shadowshot – Moebius Quiver – Super
          - Fire two volleys of three Void Arrows in a cone which seek out enemies and spawn Void Anchors on impact. Shadowshot makes tethered enemies Volatile and deals increased damage to tethered targets.
        - Stylish Executioner – Aspect
          - Defeating a Weakened, Suppressed, or Volatile target grants Invisibility and Truesight. After performing a Stylish Execution, your next melee attack while Invisible Weakens enemies.
      - Sentinel Titan:
      ![Titan](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/153/153057/JJ_Void_Titan.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=2985911544)
        - Overwatch – Aspect
          - Cast a Void-empowered Barricade to grant a Void Overshield to yourself and nearby allies. The empowered Barricade slowly regenerates the Void Overshield of allies bunkering behind it.
        - Shield Toss – Projectile Melee
          - Hurl your shield towards an enemy. The shield can ricochet off enemies and surfaces, granting you a small chunk of Void Overshield for each enemy hit.
      - Voidwalker Warlock:
      ![Warlock](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/153/153057/JJ_Void_Warlock.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=2985911544)
        - Pocket Singularity – Projectile Melee:
          - Launch a tracking, unstable ball of Void energy that detonates when it nears an enemy, pushing targets away from the blast and making them Volatile.
        - Child of the Old Gods – Aspect
          - Cast your Rift to summon a sentient black hole which hovers at your side, waiting for a target. It will launch itself at enemies, then begin siphoning their energy and weakening them, refunding their life force back to you as either grenade and melee energy (if you are using Healing Rift) or health (if you are using Empowering Rift). Defeating enemies who are being siphoned by the Child will refund some Rift energy.

  - (Relevant) Known Issues:
    - *Note: There are WAY more known issues than I am listing here, please [read the full TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50655) for more known issues.*
    - Some players on PC are unable to launch the game due to missing an unknown file.
    - In Mission: Cocoon, players on PC may experience game crashes.
    - Opening the Armor Synthesis screen with a piece of faction armor (Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy armor and armor ornaments) equipped will cause the game to crash.
    - We are investigating issues relating to multiple steps of the Wayfinder’s Voyage quest not completing as intended. Players stuck on a step, particularly Step 4, should abandon and reacquire the quest to continue progressing the quest.
    - The barriers surrounding the Scorch Cannons in the Fallen Walker public event repel anything near them, preventing Heroic completions of the event.
    - In the Astral Alignment activity, joining an encounter in progress will block players from completing the encounter.
    - Progression toward the Tracing the Stars quest doesn’t count if players pick up Atlas Skews before they pick up the quest, or if they pick up Skews on another character.
    - The Ascendant Ballast I Season Challenge isn‘t properly tracking when players pick up Wayfinding Runes in the Shattered Realm. Players are encouraged to pick up the Waterwheel Rune first so they can complete the weekly challenge this week. Players affected by this issue will have to wait until Week-2 this Season to complete this challenge.
    - Some players are blocked from entering the door in the Vault of Glass opening encounter. Players who leave their fireteam, return to Orbit, and re-join their fireteam can receive their rewards and progress through the rest of the raid.
    - Knights in the Prophecy Dungeon are incorrectly dropping Light and Dark motes based on the player’s location.
    - The Withering Heat artifact mod has no description text. When this mod is equipped, causing damage with a Solar ability weakens Champions for a short duration.
    - The Fire and Ice artifact mod only spawns one Solar and Stasis Well.
    - The Lucky Pants Exotic Hunter leg armor's elemental affinity cannot be changed.
- The voice of Savathûn is Debra Wilson!
- Author's Note:
  - Next month marks SEVEN years of Destiny.
  - Seven years of space magic, Crucible, patch notes, community, and more.
  - We still have so far to go with you all.
  - Cheers, dmg04
