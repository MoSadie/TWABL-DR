TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we talk rituals and reputation.
- Week 2 of Solstice of Heroes has begun.
- __Six weeks until the next Season.__
- This week the Season 15 appetizer comes in the form of ritual reputation updates.
- Earning A Reputation:
  - Starting in Season 15...
    - The reputation systems will now be known as Cricible, Gambit, and Vanguard Ranks.
      - The names Infamy and Valor will be retired, Glory lives on.
      - There is a new Trials Ranks in Season 15, more in a future TWAB.
    - Ranks will be rebalanced to have similar progression times.
      - Goal is to let players reset Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit Ranks slightly faster, on average, than Valor currently allows.
      - No more ritual-specific rules that impede progress.
      - No more win streaks, replaced with activity streaks.
      - Reputation bonus weeks will all be 2x.
      - Bounties will no longer provide reputation as a reward.
    - The time to reset from an all-losses player to an all-wins player will be around 2x (down from 3-4x).
  - Glory lives on, with win streaks. They may change it in the future.
  - Vanguard Ranks:
    - **REMINDER: VANGUARD TOKENS GET DELETED AT THE END OF THE SEASON!**
    - Vanguard Reputation comes from these activites: Strikes, Nightfalls, Battlegrounds.
      - Nightfall gives bonuses based on completion medals.

      - Zavala will have a full reward track like Lord Shaxx and Drifter.
    - Activity Streaks and Reputation Bonuses:
      - The longer you stay in Vanguard activities, (playlist or direct launch) the larget your streak.
      - Minor detours, like visiting the Tower for Bounties or the H.E.L.M. for Postmaster will not break streak, but being AFK or quitting activities will.

    - Season Ritual Weapon Quest and Ornaments
      - Earning the Ritual Weapon (and its Ornaments) has been changed to be earned as the player earns reputation.

    - Grandmasters and Conqueror Gilding:
      - Catch-up node will become available at the same time as Grandmasters, as long as you have a Conqueror title that _ungilded_ for that Season.
      - Catch-up node contains all Grandmaster Nightfalls that the Fireteam Leader has NOT completed the Gilded Triumph for.
      - Once you have gilded your title, the catch-up node will no longer be available.
