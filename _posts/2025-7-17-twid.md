TL;DR:

## The Edge of Fate is LIVE!

The Edge of Fate launched on Tuesday. This marks the beginning of both the Year of Prophecy (continuing with the launch of Renegades in December) and the Fate Saga (which will be focused on {% include spoiler.html text="the Nine" %})

But you all know that already.

## Voice Acting Update: The Edge of Fate

A few months ago it was announced that some voice talent was unavailable to record lines for The Edge of Fate. Today, these conflicts have been resolved, and lines are being actively re-recorded for affected characters. There is no specific date yet, but when more details are available, they will be shared.

## The {% include spoiler.html text="Desert Perpetual" %} Launches on Saturday

The new raid launches on July 19th at 10 AM PT! Contest mode is live for the first 48 hours, but only one fireteam will conquer the World First Race.

### World First Race Info

In the [July 10 TWID]({% post_url 2025-7-10-twid %}#world-first-race-info), it was mentioned that completing The Edge of Fate campaign in Legendary difficulty will get you ready for the raid. That remains true, as the required Power Level to participate in the raid is 100. Of course, you can finish the campaign on Normal difficulty and grind to get to that number; it's your choice!

## Season: Reclamation Has Started

The Edge of Fate marks the start of a new era for Destiny 2, with many changes that work as the foundation for the future of the game. Even familiar names, like Seasons, are getting many adjustments, so let's talk about what Season: Reclamation will bring to the table.

For some context, a reminder of some key dates for the Year of Prophecy:

- **July 15th** - The Edge of Fate launches and Season: Reclamation started
    - **September 9th** - The Ash & Iron Major Update drops
- **December 2nd** - Renegades launches and Season: Lawless begins
    - **March 3rd** - The Shadow & Order Major Update drops

Season: Reclamation and future seasons will feature a calendar of content releases, featuring additional activities in the Portal as well as new and returning events. These events will have exclusive gear and rewards, including Holofoil weapons.

Here are the next three events and their dates, plus what is coming to the Portal in the coming weeks:

- **Week of July 15th**
    - Portal launch and the Shooting Range opens in the Tower
- **Week of July 22nd**
    - Onslaught: Midtown and Onslaught: Widow's Court arrive in Fireteam Ops
    - Starcrossed Exotic Mission arrives in Pinnacle Ops
- **Week of July 29th**
    - The Arms Week event launches with a focus on Hand Cannons
    - Trials of Osiris is back with new armor sets and tiered weapons to earn
    - The Coil activity opens in Fireteam Ops featuring three different paths to play
- **Week of August 5th and 19th**
    - The Solstice event will take place
    - Matchmaking opens for Grandmaster Fireteam Ops (Expert & Master matchmaking opens on the 22nd and 29th, respectively)
- **Week of September 2nd**
    - Heavy Metal event returns
- **September 9th**
    - Ash & Iron Major Update

Throughout the Season there will be booster weeks where a gameplay or progression buff will be active in the Portal. The first booster, Special Surge, starts next week and buffs Special Ammo drops in all PvE activities in the Portal.

In the Ash & Iron Major Update, launching on September 9, Guardians will return to the Plaguelands and participate in a new activity highlighter event: New Territory. This event sets up a brand-new activity called Reclaim, a three-player mission where resources are limited and playing as a team is a requirement for success. The Portal will expand with additional activities, customization options, new weapons & armor, and the new Ultimate difficulty level accessible across all of Solo, Fireteam, and Pinnacle Ops.

Lastly, not much has been talked about The Edge of Fate raid dropping on July 19, and that's totally intentional so you can discover everything about it yourselves. Just know that plans for the Epic Raid, which will add new content and rewards after Ash & Iron launches, will be shared when the time is right.

## Player Support Report

### PvP Competitive Playlist

We are aware of an issue impacting the Competitive playlist where players are placed in higher ranks than intended after completing their placement matches. We will provide updates when more information is available.

### Timeline of Future Updates

As we continue investigating issue reports, we have identified root causes for many and are planning our resolution deployment timelines. Dates and fixes are subject to change based on test validation.

- 9.0.0.3: Tuesday, July 22 - Targeting fixes for:
    - Incorrect ammo gains on Area-Denial Grenade Launchers, Rocket Sidearms, and Rocket Launchers with the Bipod perk.
    - Additional Kepler-related soft-locks and crashes.
    - Third Iteration Scout Rifle does more damage than intended.
- 9.0.0.4: Tuesday, July 29 - Targeting fixes for:
    - Matterspark motion sickness and visual improvements.
    - Holofoil visuals unintentionally changing.
    - Tangled Web perk not suspending Champions.
- We are still investigating the following high-priority issues and will provide target fix dates when available.
    - Leaving The Edge of Fate missions early prevents players from relaunching them.
    - Audio issues on PlayStation 5 consoles.
    - PlayStation 4 consoles crash when entering the Tower.

### Ammo Economy Feedback

As we continue to process feedback, we'll be shooting out some clarifications and additional information to help players better understand many of the changes to core systems within Destiny 2.

In the new system, ammo bricks drop more frequently and consistently than before when defeating enemies but contain less ammo per brick. If you are feeling short of ammo, there are some buildcrafting options you can leverage to increase your ammo drops/amounts per drop:

- All weapons except Swords have an Ammo Generation stat, which influences how much they contribute to the Ammo Meters
- You can improve the Ammo Generation stat using the Ammo Generation armor mods (Chest), or the Bandolier or Abundant Ammo mods on the weapon itself
- ⁠Finder mods (Head) directly scale all gains to the meter for the corresponding ammo type, and can stack up to 3x
- Scavengers (Legs) grant extra ammo on pickups for matched weapons
- The newly introduced Weapon stat from 100-200 also offers an escalating chance for ammo bricks to contain additional ammo, and your chance can be seen on the inspection screen

We are also investigating a few weapons that are receiving less ammunition than intended (some Area-Denial Grenade Launchers, Rocket Sidearms, Bipod Rocket Launchers). Once we have details on a fix, we'll let you know.

### Known Issues List

- Hitmarkers are not functioning as intended.
- Due to an issue, Conquest activities have been disabled until a fix can be deployed at a later date.
- Matterspark is causing visual flickering on ultrawide aspect ratios.
- Players can be blocked from launching The Edge of Fate missions after error coding out or leaving in-progress.
    - Players can sometimes work around this by having a different member of the fireteam who also has access to the mission launching it for them.
- Players cannot attack in Matterspark if primary vehicle fire is not bound.
- Players can soft-lock themselves if reaching the Relocator in Exile's Accord too quickly.
- Activities in The Gorge may not activate the first time players enter the area. Players are advised to leave and attempt to load back in to progress.
- The Tangled Web artifact perk does not suspend Champions as expected. Unstoppable Champions will still stun from the suspend effect.
- Orbs of Power granted by the Orbs of Restoration Leg Armor mod only grant ability energy to Phoenix Dive when that class ability is equipped by a Solar Warlock.
- Vex Mythoclast's rate of fire is incorrect.
- The Graviton Spike Exotic Hand Cannon is missing its lore tab.
- The armor set perks for the Unfaltering Focus and [REDACTED] sets have been temporarily disabled to prevent game crashes.
- Players can become soft-locked at a specific spot during the Saturnism mission if they die prior to upgrading Relocator.
- Playstation 5 and Xbox users are experiencing intermittent audio issues, which may eventually lead to crashes.
