In a surprising pre-TWAB, Bungie has released a bunch of new information about upcoming changes to mods, loadouts, and general buildcrafting.

TL;DR:
- Loadouts:
    - You can unlock up to 10 loadout slots (unlocked by gaining Guardian Ranks)
    - Loadouts can have a custom name, icon and color.
- Mods:
    - New mod customization screen!
        - Very similar to the armor cosmetics screen.
        - Can see both armor and weapon mods.
    - Update on getting mods:
        - Now mods are earned by achieving certain Guardian Ranks.
        - All mods are unlocked by Guardian Rank 6. (Which most players who have spent time in the game should already be at when the system launches.)
    - Mod Energy types are being removed.
    - Combat Style slots are being converted into an additional normal mod slot.
    - Some mod energy costs are being reduced.
    - Instead of Weapon Archetype mods (ex. Hand Cannon Loader), those mods will be based on Weapon Damage Type (ex. Solar Loader).
    - Artifact mods are changing to unlockable, *passive* perks!
        - Can only select 12 perks at a time. (Can't let you use the whole artifact at once.)
        - But... resetting is free!
        - On Artifice armor: The extra slot will be converted into a special mod slot that grants a +3 to a stat of your choice.
    - Armor Charge Mods:
        - Rework of the Charged with Light + Elemental Well mods.
        - Socketing an Armor Charge mod will grant access to the system.
        - You can hold up to 3 charges at a time. (Up to 6 with a mod)
        - Picking up an Orb of Power will grant a stack.
            - Most other mods that granted Charged With Light or Elemental Well will grant a stack.
        - Some mods provide a passive benefit from holding charges.
            - If one is equipped, charges decay at a rate of 1 per 10 seconds. (Delay can be extended by some mods.)
        - Other mods are active benefits, consuming 1 or more stacks.
        - Finishers now comsume Armor Charges instead of Super energy.
    - Elemental Wells:
        - Now flavored for each subclass:
            - Ionic Traces (Arc)
            - Firesprite (Solar)
            - Void Breaches (Void)
            - Stasis Shards (Stasis)
            - {% include spoiler.html text="[REDACTED]" %} (Strand)
        - Spawned not by mods, but by subclass.
    - Warmind Cells:
        - Gone in Season 20.
- Gameplay updates:
    - Match Game is gone! (From high-difficulty activities.) There's some other changes in the future on shields.
    - Champions:
        - Barrier Champions can now be pierced by the following effects:
            - Voilatile Rounds
            - Radiant
            - Strand (somehow)
        - Overload Champions can now be stunned by the following effects:
            - Jolted
            - Suppressed
            - Slowed
        - Unstoppable Champions can now be slowed by the following effects:
            - Blinded
            - Shattering (freeze -> shatter)
            - Solar ignition
            - Strand (somehow)

- In general a bunch of balance changes and deduplication of mods.

- Looking ahead:
    - There is more to say as we get closer to Lightfall's launch.
    - Remember the system is never final, and changes will be made as we go.
    - Everyone's excited see what gets built!.
