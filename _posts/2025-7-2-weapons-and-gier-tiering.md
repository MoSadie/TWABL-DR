TL;DR:

## From One to Five

| Tier | Benefits |
|------|----------|
| Tier 1 | - Base weapon, can use new seasonal mods once acquired. |
| Tier 2 | - Enhanced traits |
| Tier 3 | - Drops with two traits per column |
| Tier 4 | - Enhanced weapon mods (Including Seasonal mods) <br> - Enhanced weapon components (like barrels and magazines) |
| Tier 5 | - Enhanced origin traits <br> - Three traits per column <br> - Access to a unique ornament (with unique shader) and a unique combat flair |

Weapons when masterworked will also receive a bonus to their stats equal to their tier. For example, a Tier 5 weapon will receive a +5 to all stats when masterworked. (This is in addition to the +10 to all stats that masterworking provides.)

## New Seasonal Mods

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Temporal Loader | This weapon loads ammo from reserves when dealing damage to targets that are slowed, frozen, or suspended. |
| Temporal Tracker | Gain bonus aim assistance or projectile tracking for a moderate duration after picking up an Orb of Power. |
| Temporal Adapter | Readying this weapon grants it bonus stability, handling, and reload speed for a moderate duration that is borrowed from an alternate timeline version of the weapon. Swords gain bonus charge rate and guard resistance. |
| Temporal Armaments | This weapon gains bonus damage versus Cabal and Vex targets. |
| Temporal Blast | This weapon stores a portion of its damage dealt into Charges. At five Charges, the weapon's next shot creates an explosive blast on impact that damages nearby enemies. |

## Earning the New Gear

You’ll begin your journey on Kepler earning Tier 1 gear. With a focus on gaining Power, you’ll earn new weapons and slowly begin to find occasionally Tier 2 gear as you unravel Kepler’s mysteries. Upon completing major accomplishments or raising your Seasonal Power, you’ll earn permanent upgrades to Kepler’s reward tiers.

Once you complete the campaign, new difficulties will be unlocked for replay accessing higher gear tiers and a post-campaign activity will appear from time to time, providing even more Kepler loot while it lasts!

Throughout The Portal, modifiers will up the challenge but also increase your chances of more rewards. The harder the activity and the faster you complete it, the higher the reward score you'll earn, providing better chances to earn higher gear tiers at the end of the activity.

Lastly, once the raid opens, players will find new challenges to acquire pinnacle tiered rewards, but no spoilers here!
