TL;DR:
- This week: Mithrax told the legend of The Saint.
- If you haven't yet, PLAY THE WEEKLY QUEST FOR THIS WEEK.
- Iron Banner returns next week from reset on 6/8 to reset on 6/15.
- Splicing Down the Runway:
  - Since fashion is the true endgame of Destiny, it's time for a fashion contest!
  - The prize is an unique emblem!
  - Exact details on how to enter and what to submit can be found in the TWAB!
- Another Patch Out The Door (Support Section)
  - Earlier today, Hotfix 3.2.0.3 was released.
    - This contained the Stasis tuning, and a few bugfixes. (Patch notes here: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50396 )
    - Patch Notes Highlights:
      - The Empty Tank Lost Sector now rewards the leg Exotics when they are advertised.
      - The Archon's Thunder Machine Gun and Riiswalker Shotgun can now be acquired from Lord Saladin, Iron Engrams, Bounties, or post-match Iron Banner rewards.
      - Statis subclass balance changes.
  - There's been a rise in reports of photosensitive players having issues with certain in-game effects. They've put out a notification in-game, and are updating the EULA, and also looking to adjust some of the effects later this year.
  - Teleporting Enemies Update: They've made some server-side changes that should reduce the "teleporty" enemies.
  - PC Performance Update: If you had game performance drop significantly after Beyond Light released, they're working on it. It may not be in the patch notes always, but they're working on it. By now it should be hopefully back to pre-BL launch performance.
  - Expunge Rewards: The weekly completion of the mission rewards non-pinnacle gear. The Pinnacle gear will come from the weekly challenge launching June 15th.
  - (Relevant) Known Issues:
    - Gravity Cannons can kill players in Expunge when walking up to them from behind.
    - Some players are having loading issues, resulting in them and their weapons being somewhat invisible in activities.
    - Sentinel Titans can use up Charged with Light stacks when they throw a shield when their Super is half full while they have the Energy Converter mod equipped.
    - The stat tracker for fastest Expunge completion time gets reset for each completion.

Thanks for stopping by for another week of TWABness. Season of the Splicer has been fun so far and there’s still quite a bit to look forward to. There is Iron Banner next week, weekly Raid challenges, Vault of Glass difficulty options, Solstice of Heroes, and more. 

Even outside of seasonal content, there’s a lot to get excited about for the future of Destiny. A few of us have said our best days are ahead. With every playtest, shot of gear, or piece of concept art that passes by my desk, I can’t help but agree...

That was a quick tease, and we are eager to show you more about The Witch Queen. Expect to hear from us again with more details later in the summer. We have some awesome content to play between now and then. See you out there in the wild. 

Cheers,
