TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we take a pass on Armor Mods and Exotics.
- If you haven't yet, play the Epilogue mission, it's great!
- Less than two weeks until the Destiny 2 Showcase!
- Season 15 Champion Mods revealed on Twitter: <https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1425494097259810816>
- Fine Tuning:
  - Controller Sensitivity and Traction:
    - Added a sprint turn speed scalar option (allowed values 0.3 to 0.8)
      - **Removed the Traction mod.**
    - Added additional controller sensitivity options (1-10 is the same as before, 11-20 increases over that)
    - Added an ADS sensitivity modifier (allowed values 0.5 to 1.5)
  - Super Regenerating Exotics:
    - [Shards of Galanor](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/691578979): Increased the amount of Super granted for hits, but total Super regain is now capped at 50%.

    - [Stormdancer's Brace](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/1996008488): Now also refunds up to 50% of your Super energy after your Super ends, based on the number of kills.
    - [Geomag Stabilizers](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/121305948): Removed "sprint to top off your Super."
  - Retunes and Reworks:
    - Hunter:
      - [The Bombardiers](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/1219761634)
        - The bomb now has a secondary effect based on your subclass type:
          - Blind for Arc.
          - Burn for Solar.
          - Slow for Stasis.
          - Suppress for Void.
          - Note: The suppression will not affect a Guardian in Super.
      - [Graviton Forfeit](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/2773056939)
        - Increased the bonus invisibility duration.
        - The melee regeneration speed now increases based on the number of enemies near you.
        - While you are invisible, your Recovery is greatly increased, and your weapons reload more quickly.
      - [Lucky Pants](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/193869522)
        - Added intrinsic Hand Cannon Holster mod, replaced previous functionality with the following:
        - "When you ready a fully-loaded Hand Cannon that deals Kinetic damage or damage matching your subclass energy type, for a short time each hit against a combatant from that Hand Cannon increases the damage of the next shot.”
          - Note: No, Hawkmoon won’t be able to one-shot a raid boss using these legs. Other Hand Cannons will get a fun edge in combat, though!
        - What is a Hand Cannon Holster mod? A new kind of mod that reloads stowed weapons. More on that below…
    - Titan:
      - [Precious Scars](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/3974038291)
        - Will now also create a burst of healing and bonus Recovery around you when you kill an enemy with a matching damage and subclass type.
      - [Icefall Mantle](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/1467044898)
        - Removed the slower class ability recharge scalar.
    - Warlock:
      - [Verity's Brow](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/2428181146)
        - Changed to trigger when you get a weapon kill that matches your subclass energy type.
        - Increased grenade bonus damage to 20% per stack. (Up from 10%)
      - [The Stag](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/2177524718)
        - Grants damage reduction to allied Guardians standing in your Rifts.
          - 25% against combatants, 15% against players.
      - [Promethium Spur](https://braytech.org/inspect/item/235591051)
        - Now while standing in a Rift, Solar weapon kills give you class ability energy.
          - If your class ability energy is full, instead it spawns a _combination_ healing/empowering Rift at the target's location.
  - Finders, Scavengers, and Holsters - Oh My!
    - Ammo Finder
      - Now have an increased chance to spawn ammo on kills with primary weapons, and a further increased chance with Exotic Primaries.
    - Scavenger
      - Multiple copies of Scavenger mods of the same type no longer stack.
    - Holster
      - This is a new type of leg armor mod that will gradually reload stowed weapons of the matching type over time.
        - Multiple copies of Holster mods of the same type will increase the rate ammo is reloaded.
      - The following weapon types will have Holster mods: Auto Rifle, Fusion Rifle, Grenade Launcher (Power), Hand Cannon, Linear Fusion Rifle, Machine Gun, Pulse Rifle, Scout Rifle, Shotgun, Sidearm, Submachine Gun, Sniper Rifle, and Trace Rifle.
        - Hand Cannon excludes Eriana’s Vow.
        - Rocket Launchers, Breech-loaded Grenade Launchers, and Bows will not have Holster mods, as we didn’t want to affect any weapon that has a magazine size of 1.
  - Warmind Cells. Interlinked.
    - TL;DR: They are currently too powerful.
