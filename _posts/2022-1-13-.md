TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, TWABs are bacK!
- We are one month away from The Witch Queen!
- These TWABS will start to contain **spoilers** for Witch Queen content. (As the TL;DR writer I'll try my best to spoiler tag anything important, but read at your own risk.)
- NEW TRAILER:
- {% include youtube.html id="YLPG9jbivpk" %}
- Artifact Mods Update: \*Insert Orbs Meme Here\*
    - These changes will happen starting next season (Season 16)
    - No more limits on artifact mod unlocks.
        - XP costs remain the same for mods 1-12.
        - Resetting is still available since a lot more XP will be required to unlock the whole artifact.
    - Confirmed Artifact Mods:
        - {% include spoiler.html text="Anti-Barrier Scout Rifle" %}
        - {% include spoiler.html text="Anti-Barrier Bow" %}
        - {% include spoiler.html text="Overload Auto Rifle" %}
        - {% include spoiler.html text="Overload SMG" %}
        - {% include spoiler.html text="Unstoppable Glaive" %}
        - {% include spoiler.html text="Multiple other Glaive Mods" %}
    - In addition to confirmed mods, changes made to Overload Champions to make stunning more reliable.
    - Changes to Masterworked armor:
        - Changing element cost has been reduced for *fully* Masterworked armor:
            - 10,000 Glimmer + 1 Upgrade Module for Masterworked Legendary armor
            - 20,000 Glimmer + 1 Upgrade Module for Masterworked Exotic armor
        - The cost for non-Masterworked armor remains unchanged.
    - Changes to Orbs of Power Generation:
        - No longer tied to Masterworked weapons.
        - Now provided by a suite of Helmet armor mods.
            - These will be auto-unlocked for all players.
            - Mods are based on damage type, so one mod can cover multiple weapons.
        - As a TL;DR note: There have since been some tweets on this change by CMs reminding us that other changes are happening. ([See the Nov 11th, 2021 TWAB for a reminder]({% post_url 2021-11-11-twab %}))

    - Colorblind Modes:
        - They are investigating issues with colors becoming harder to distinguish across multiple colorblind modes after 3.4.0.2
    - Steam Negative Silver Balances:
        - The issue causing this has been fixed, log out and log back in to resolve the issue.
    - Hotfix 3.4.0.2:
        - Released this week.
        - The Xenology quest from Xur can now be recovered if deleted.
        - Challenger's Proving V now successfully unlocks after players complete Challenger's Proving IV.
    - Twitch Extension Resolved Issues:
        - Hotfix 3.4.0.2 also resolved these issues with Twitch Extension bounties:
            - The Dreissigste emblem is now available in Collections.
            - The Watcher's Shade shader will now be granted upon completion of the Gift Sub bounty.
                - Players who completed the bounty but did not receive it will be able to claim it from Amanda Holliday in a future update.
    - (Relevant) Known Issues:
        - We are currently investigating an increase in MARMOT errors.
        - We’re investigating reports that the Wicked Overgrowth Shader didn’t unlock in Collections for some players after the 3.4.0.2 fix.
- Operation: Save the New Lights:
    - If you recall, Dares of Eternity was pulling in players even if they didn't have the recommended Power, leaving them 50 Power below basic combatants.
    - There was a community effort called "Operation: Save the New Lights" where experienced players would lower their Power to join into low Power lobbies and switch back to high Power gear, carrying the New Lights to victory.
    - To celebrate both the true embodiment of a Guardian and the New Lights who stuck through it, Bungie is giving both groups [the special Circumflex Diacritic emblem](https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1479558466117251072) for all who complete Dares of Eternity from now until January 18th.

- Author's Note:
    - Threads of Light is still accepting submissions! (Use #ThreadsOfLight with a screenshot of your Guardian's Appearance page to enter on Twitter or Instagram)
