TL;DR:

## Solstice Final Week

It's the last week of the Solstice event! Make sure to claim any rewards before the event ends on August 19th. (Check the details on what to claim [here](#solstice-rewards)!)

## Warlock Abilities Tuning Preview for 9.1.0

(MoSadie's note: If you want additional developer insights please check out the [Original TWID]({{ page.bungie_url }}).)

The feedback is seen, not everything will change immediately, but there is a tuning pass coming with Ash & Iron (aka Major Update 9.1.0) on September 9th.

Hunters and Titans, don't worry. There is more to discuss with you over the next few weeks.

### Abilities

#### Empowering Rift (Class Ability)

- Standing in Empowering Rift now generates grenade, melee, and class-ability energy over time
- Final blows while standing in Empowering Rift now generate bonus Special and Heavy ammo progress

#### Weavewalk (Strand Aspect)

- Exiting Weavewalk now grants Woven Mail for you and nearby allies
    - Woven Mail duration is relative to time spent in Weavewalk
- Increased horizontal movement on enter and exit
- Increased Fragment slots from 2 to 3

#### Weaver's Call (Strand and Prismatic Aspect)

- Now generates roosted Threadling progress when giving damage of any type
- Threadling damage now returns class-ability energy
    - Works on all Threadling damage while this Aspect is equipped

#### Frostpulse (Stasis Aspect)

- Freezing enemies now generates class-ability energy
    - Works on all Stasis Freezes while this Aspect is equipped

#### Pocket Singularity (Void and Prismatic Melee)

- Now has two charges at base
- Projectile lifetime increased from 1.1s to 2s
- Reworked projectile tracking to favor targets closest to initial trajectory
- Reduced detonation knockback on players by 50%

### Exotic Armor

#### Eunoia

- Increased projectile damage at max range from +15% to +20%
- Tuned distance-to-damage curve to make the maximum damage distance easier to identify
- Increased projectile tracking by ~40%
- In addition to the primary projectile, the sub-projectiles now benefit from Ember of Ashes and Ember of Eruption

### General

This applies to all classes.

#### Threadlings

- Increased damage vs. combatants by 20%

### Upcoming Fixes

Here are some updates on investigations into feedback and bug reports for a few Exotics.

#### Starfire Protocol

- Confirmed an issue where Starfire Protocol was not returning as much energy as expected on empowered hits. The fix will be deployed in 9.0.0.7, raising it back to the intended 5%

#### Crown of Tempests

- Investigations continue into an issue where Crown of Tempests no longer grants stacks on multikills. Aiming for a fix when Renegades goes live

#### Rime-Coat Raiment

- Investigations continue into an issue where Rime-Coat Raiment-generated Stasis crystals would inconsistently apply Devour when Feed the Void is active. A fix is being honed in on and is expected when Renegades goes live

#### Boots of the Assembler

- Confirmed an issue where Noble Rounds won't work on a teammate that enters the Warlock's Rift. A fix will be deployed with Ash & Iron (9.1.0)

#### Wings of Sacred Dawn

- Missing patch note: Wings no longer reloads your equipped weapon, as this led to some problematic behaviors around single shot magazine weapons such as Bows

#### Contraverse Hold

- Reports indicated it does not return energy as expected, investigations reveal this appears to be true specifically with some combatants in the Firing Range only. The Firing Range combatants will be updated in a future update

#### Nezarec's Sin

- Reports of the regeneration buff no longer working during multikill streaks are believed to have been resolved with the 9.0.0.5 update, alongside the fix for the "sprint bug"

(MoSadie's note: Fun fact! Our clan ran into a similar issue with Eager Edge, and we haven't run into it after the update.)

## Crucible Power and Rewards

### What's Live Already

As of update 9.0.0.6:

- Everyone in a match now has a chance to earn an additional roll, instead of one per team
- The Competitive playlist weapon (Solemn Remembrance) has a chance to drop on completion instead of wins
- Lowered the B-grade score threshold for reward ranks copper and bronze (Power 10-300)
    - This makes it easier to earn bonus drops and bonus focus rewards in PvP.
- Increased the gear tier for B+ at reward ranks bronze and silver (Power 200-400)

### What's Coming Soon

Planned for Ash & Iron (Update 9.1.0)

- Increasing bonus drop frequency when playing Crucible Ops
- Increasing the amount of score earned on losses
- Re-tuning score thresholds for all grads at reward ranks copper and bronze (Power 10-300) to make earning higher Power and Gear Tier more consistent
- Increasing the highest potential gear tier at reward ranks copper, bronze, and silver (Power 10-400)
- Increasing Power adjustors for PvP (Power 10-300)

There is more reward changes to come outside of the Crucible as well, including with The Desert Perpetual Raid. More to share in the weeks ahead.
