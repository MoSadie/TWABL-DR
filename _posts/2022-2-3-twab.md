TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we've got a lot going on.
- Firstly, [BUNGIE JOINS SONY INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50988)
    - TL;DR For Destiny 2 not much of a change to day-to-day adventures. Still multi-platform, self-published, and the same game everywhere.
- Also **1,000,000** Guardians have pre-ordered The Witch Queen.
- Weapons and Gear trailer as well:

- Welcome to the Enclave (WEAPON CRAFTING PREVIEW)
    - Beginning your Quest (to Craft)
        - Early in The Witch Queen campaign, you'll get an introductory quest that runs you through the ins and outs of crafting.
        - In the first and second missions of The Witch Queen, _free to all players_, Guardians will uncover the **Deepsight** ability and be introduced to the Enclave:
        - ![The Enclave](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/156/156235/JB_Weapon_Crafting_Enclave_23.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=2665691163)
        - First weapon crafted: Glaive (You'll be provided materials.)
        - Crafting requires Patterns (earned through quests and other objectives)
        - To unlock perks for weapons, you use the Deepsight ability:
            - Randomly rolled weapons will have a chance to have a new ability: _Deepsight Resonance_ (indicated by a red border on the weapon and a slot in the inspect view)
            - Completing the objective allows you to extract the essence of the perks on _that_ weapon.
    - Levelling Your Weapon & Enhanced Traits:
        - As you use your weapon, it gains levels which adds slight bonuses. This will be the bulk of crafting playtime.
        - Also, if you want to make changes to an already crafted weapon, _you can do that!_
    - Mementos:
        - Cosmetic unlockables tied to specific activities.
        - Also can add activity-specific trackers.
        - At launch, one will be available to earn: Gambit.
        - Requires max weapon level.
        - More planned through Trials of Osiris and Grandmaster Nightfalls
    - Exotic Crafting:
        - That's right, not just Legendary weapons, but Exotic weapons can be crafted!
        - The Osteo Striga Exotic SMG as well as the class-specific Glaives are crafted, once you find their Patterns of course.
        - Note: Not as much customization here, more focused on fine-tuning identity. (ex. barrels and stocks)
- Tuning Up, Tuning Down, Tuning all Around:
    - This will read like a patch preview.
    - (TL;DR Note: There are justifications for every change, refer to [the full TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50995) for details.)
    - Introducing the Seasonal Pursuit Weapon: The Reckless Endangerment Pursuit Shotgun (Main Perks: Steady Hands and Snapshot)

    - On a final, somber note:
        - Seraphim Crypt, one of the German community volunteers, has passed away.
        ```
        Words are incredibly difficult to find here. Seraphim has been among the Destiny community since the start, pitching in to help anyone who needed an assist, or simply sitting back and relaxing among our forums to pass the time. We’d met him in person on his own home turf when visiting Germany for gamescom, and even had him come out to Seattle to help us with a Community Summit. Every exchange was positive, inspiring, and heartfelt. His love for this community was immeasurable. You could tell with every exchange how wonderful, unique, and passionate he was – and how much of an inspiration he could be, not only to us at Bungie, but to players of our worldwide community.
 
        Thank you for everything, Seraphim. You are loved. You are missed. We hope you are able to rest well, and we are sending our love to your family.
        ```
    - Much love, dmg04
