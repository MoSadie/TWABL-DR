TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we start shaking up the sandbox.
- If you missed it, Joe Blackburn put out a series of tweets on the future of PvP in Destiny 2: <https://twitter.com/joegoroth/status/1422951516562886657>
  - TL;DR: There is a plan, it will take a while. They want to be more consistant with PvP content.
- The Best of Your Ability:
  - Sandbox changes are being broken up over three weeks.
    - This week: Abilities
    - Next week: Armor and Mods
    - Last week of season: Weapons
  - Introducing Separate Melee Buttons!
    - This is an *optional* feature that is being introduced next Season.
    - In the keybinding section you will find these new keybindings:
      - Auto-Melee: New name, same function as current melee button. Is bound by default.
      - Charged melee: Always use the charged melee ability when pressed. Will not activate if nothing to hit.
      - Uncharged melee: Always used the standard melee attack when pressed.
    - Things to note:
      - Melee attacks trigger on button press, long or double press will not work as expected.
      - Game controllers have a limited number of buttons, be aware. (Cozmo recommends unchared melee on the finisher button, as finishers take priority over melee.)
      - If charged and unchaged melee is assigned to the same button the charged melee will take priority, which is the opposite of Auto-melee.
  - Long Term Ability Plans:
    - Goal: Abilities should enhance the gunplay, but not replace it.
    - Changes this season will set the stage for systemic changes in the future.
    - There will be a focus on the Crucible in paticular as well.
  - Season 15 Ability Balance Pass:
    - General Abilities:
      - Stasis Freeze:
        - Frozen players can now initiate breakout while airborne.
        - Shortened breakout animation and camera transition.
          - This means that once you decide to break out, you’ll be able to fight back sooner.
        - Differentiated long freeze and short freeze visual treatment to make each status easier to identify.
      - Slide:
        - While sliding, players now have:
