TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we march on.
- Next week is the LAST week of Solstice of Heroes. Don't forget to upgrade your armor!
- Light TWAB this week.
- Unraveling the Synthstrands:
  - Starting in Season 15, Synthstrand (The bounty purchasing currency) will be deprecated. Instead transmog bounties can be purchased for 10,000 Glimmer.
  - Goal is to reduce time needed to earn the 10 Synthweave tokens per class each Season. Also frees up an Consumable inventory slot.
- Store Renovations:
  - The new Bungie Store is now live!
  - As a reminder, all Bungie Store account passwords have been reset! Go to <https://bungiestore.com/> to reset your password.
  - As an incentive, if you reset your Bungie Store account password before _July 31st, 2021 at 11:59 PM_ you will receive an exclusive in-game emblem: New Blue

- Double Your Fun:
  - Double Rewards in Nightfalls next week!
  - Weapons to chase next week include Palindrome, THE SWARM, and Shadow Price.
  - Also, starting in Season 15 there will be a change to the Nightfall Weapon rotation.
    - Instead of 1/1/1/3 weapon rotation, there will be pairs every week of one newer and one older weapon.
    - Ex: The Comedian / Shadow Price or The Hothead / Hung Jury.
    - New spicy perk combos as well.
