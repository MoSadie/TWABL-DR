### Introducing Nonary Engrams

Starting July 1, a new item will be available at The Emissary: Nonary Engrams. These engrams are filled to the brim with hand-picked cosmetic rewards from multiple years of Destiny 2 content. Some are newer, like Holochips, while some are a blast from the past - like Crimson Days emotes.

#### How to Earn Nonary Engrams

- Starting July 1, players can purchase Nonary Engrams using 350 Nonary Manifolds from The Emissary. (Up to 20 during Rite of the Nine.)
- Starting July 8, players earn one for just logging in each day. (Make sure to claim it from the Emissary.)

### Gear Experts with new duties

#### Ada-1

As a reminder, Ada-1 will be providing a way to focus some new Exotic armor pieces with the launch of The Edge of Fate. **You must play Destiny 2 before July 15 to earn the currency needed for this temporary feature.**

In addition, the Armor Customization bounties are being simplified, removing the activity-specific requirements. There is one exception: Raid and Dungeon bounties will remain as they are now.

#### Banshee-44

Banshee-44 will start selling legacy weapons for purchase, for a small amount of Enhancement Cores and Glimmer. Perfect for completing your collection, new players in need of some initial gear, or if you just need a handful of weapons to start with in The Edge of Fate with desirable perk rolls.

### Shooting Range **AVAILABLE DAY ONE**

Originally slated for three weeks after The Edge of Fate launch, the Shooting Range will be available on day one. In case you somehow missed it, the Shooting Range is a new area for testing out your weapons, builds, and abilities.

## Iron Banner in The Edge of Fate

Iron Banner will be taking a break for a time. It will return with the Ash & Iron major update in September.

## Gambit in The Edge of Fate

Gambit is taking a form of a hiatus. Players can still play Gambit from the "Worlds" tab, and earn legacy rewards for transmog purposes.

But, this is not the end of Gambit. There are plans to being the spotlight back to Gambit in the future, with updated rewards and mechanics that players haven't seen since the days of Prime.

## Player Support Report

### Known Issues

- The Ascension Aspect isn't working with certain armor mods and Exotic armors.
- Crystals made by the Rime-Coat Raiment Exotic Chest don't reliably grant Devour while Feed the Void is equipped.
- Enhanced Recycled Energy grants no energy back.
- The Champ Title has lost its gilded status.
- When speaking to a vendor, you can hear their ambient dialogue; sometimes you hear vendor voices overlapping... which can be very confusing.
- Steps 6 and 9 of the Drowning Labyrinth quest aren't able to be completed by some players.
    - Due to this quest being a fix between character-scoped and account-scoped, if you have an alternate character and make progress on the quest, you need to play on that character to get back into the correct research paper level for your main character.
- Sometimes in the Derealize Exotic mission, the Taken relic can drop below the surface during the Vhriisk encounter.
- When damaging Shrieker bosses in the Sundered Doctrine dungeon, players receive critical damage feedback, but damage is actually regular base damage.
- When tracking Ikora's Drowning Labyrinth quest, completion of certain steps may stop progress on the next steps.
- Sometimes the Tome of Want: A Primer quest does not progress after meeting Step 3 and Step 4 requirements.
- Memento shaders can be previewed on armor in the Armor Management screen. This is not intended, and Mementos aren't being considered for use on armor.
- Secant Filaments and Spirit of the Filaments can’t grant Devour while Facet of Protection is equipped.
