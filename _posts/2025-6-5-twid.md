### Frequent Questions

#### Will we get more vault space?

Not in The Edge of Fate, but there is more space planned (and some quality of life features) for Renegades.

#### Will I be able to use my current gear?

Yes, your gear is still viable. Especially for the start of the expansion and even Content Mode for the World First Race.

New gear will become helpful as you get involved in certain activities. There will be more TWIDs and even an upcoming full livestream to talk about gear.

#### What new weapon archetypes are coming?

Wait for the next developer streams to learn more!

#### What's happing to Mobility, Recover, and Resilience?

Scroll down to [here](#existing-armor-stats) and [here](#but-what-do-the-old-stats-get-set-to) for the news!

#### Is the Director going away?

Portal is the main focus, but the Director is not going away.

### What are Unstable Cores?

Unstable Cores is a new currency earned from dismantling high-level gear, among other sources. It resets with each six-month Season. More info on economy changes will be coming in a future TWID.

### But what do the old stats get set to?

- Mobility is fixed to what 30 once was for Titans and Warlocks, and 40 for Hunters.
    - Additionally, there are new leg armor mods to adjust this higher.
- Resilience is fixed to what 100 once was.
- Recovery is fixed to around what 60 once was.

### Ability Stats and Recharge Rates

- At 0-30, the recharge rate is slower then they used to.
- At 70-100+, the recharge rate is faster than they used to be.

- Any "chunk" energy gains (like Demolitionist, or similar perks) and any energy recharge scalars (think Crown of Tempests) will be scaled by your stat investment.
    - Between 0-70, they will give less then the live game.
    - Between 70-100, they will give more than the live game.

### Exotic Armor 3.0

With The Edge of Fate, all *new* drops of Exotic armor will have the new stats and distributions.

To help make the transition easier, Ada-1 will be able to "reproduce" Exotic Armor. Supplies are limited but most Guardians should be able to focus their choice of previous Exotics with some influence on the stats.

**NOTE: Ada-1's Exotic Focusing is only available in the Year of Prophecy!**

On Exotic Class Items, your existing items will be updated with the new stats based on the perks they have. If you have the perks you want, keep them!

More information to come in a future TWID.

## Player Support Report

### Seeker of the Nine Triumph Update

This week an issue was fixed where the triumph was character-based instead of account-based. However, progress on this triumph was unintendedly reset. To resolve this, progress will be auto-completed for collecting the collectibles in Spire of the Watcher and Ghosts of the Deep next Tuesday, June 10th. Progress earned in the Prophesy dungeon will be retained.

### Known Issues:

- Crystals made by the Rime-Coat Raiment Exotic Chest don't reliably grant Devour while Feed the Void is equipped.
- Enhanced Recycled Energy grants no energy back.
- The Champ Title has lost its gilded status.
- When speaking to a vendor, you can hear their ambient dialogue; sometimes you hear vendor voices overlapping... which can be very confusing.
- Steps 6 and 9 of the Drowning Labyrinth quest aren't able to be completed by some players.
    - Due to this quest being a fix between character-scoped and account-scoped, if you have an alternate character and make progress on the quest, you need to play on that character to get back into the correct research paper level for your main character.
- Sometimes in the Derealize Exotic mission, the Taken relic can drop below the surface during the Vhriisk encounter.
- When damaging Shrieker bosses in the Sundered Doctrine dungeon, players receive critical damage feedback, but damage is actually regular base damage.
- When tracking Ikora's Drowning Labyrinth quest, completion of certain steps may stop progress on the next steps.
- Sometimes the Tome of Want: A Primer quest does not progress after meeting Step 3 and Step 4 requirements.
- Memento shaders can be previewed on armor in the Armor Management screen. This is not intended, and Mementos aren't being considered for use on armor.
- Secant Filaments and Spirit of the Filaments can’t grant Devour while Facet of Protection is equipped.
