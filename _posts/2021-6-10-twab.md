TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie: We're walking the runway.
- It's FASHION WEEK! Submissions for the fashion contest are still open until the 13th so you can still enter for the fashion emblem!
- Vault of Glass Raid Challenges begin NEXT WEEK! These are the same challenges that Guardians faced during the day-one race, and the loot is an extra encounter chest.
- This week marked the launch of one of Bungie's inclusion clubs: Women@Bungie. More details in a blog post here: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50409
- The Gaming Community Expo (GCX) kicks off (virtually) next week!  (Note: The event is not free. ))
- Guardians assemble!
  - The reason the Boots of the Assembler were nerfed was because having too many Rifts and Noble Seekers active at once would crash the game.
  - Now that that is fixed, BOOTS OF THE ASSEMBLER ARE BEING UNNERFED. (In the next update)
  - In addition, a minor bug fix: Empowering Noble Seekers will now properly proc Benevolent Dawn.
- Crownsplitter Deleter (Support Section)
  - Golden Gun Change Clarification:
    - There was a bug in 3.0.0 that extened the range of Six Shooter. This bug was fixed in update 3.2.0, but not listed in the patch notes.
  - (Relevant) Known Issues:
    - Killing the Oppressive Mind too quickly in the Expunge: Tartarus activity blocks activity completion.
    - The Glory rank system isn’t working as intended.
    - Player Ghosts get placed at the beginning of the drill area in the Inverted Spire strike if they die anywhere in the area before the boss room.
    - Players can’t hear the Oracle sound if they are performing a finisher in the Vault of Glass raid.
    - We are continuing to investigate PC performance issues
    - There is no dialogue audio for the Inverted Spire strike
- Author's Note:
  - One more thing before we go, some Vexwave beats to vibe to: https://youtu.be/ZCBS9eQCmEE

  - Next update is scheduled for early next month. The fixes must flow.
