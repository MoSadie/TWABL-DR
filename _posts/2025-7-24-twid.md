TL;DR:

## Conquering The Desert Perpetual

After 15 hours, the winners of the World First Race is Team Nuts, made up of:

- milito
- Dabs (TheSnazzzyRock)
- Enskeria
- Silken
- mitcH
- Ham

Normal difficulty is now available for everyone who owns The Edge of Fate (and has completed the campaign)

Raid Feats are also available, very similar to the Portal customization system. Including an option for Contest Mode difficulty. There are some triumphs tied to these feats that increase the tier of rewards from the raid, so it's really worth it.

### A Bag Big Enough to Carry With

For those who have completed the raid, the Bungie Rewards are now live!

## The Edge of Fate Post-Launch Support

As things start to calm down after The Edge of Fate launch and the raid race, there's some topics that need to be addressed.

No game launch is perfect, and there were a lot of changes made that need time to adjust to. Additionally, some patch notes for Update 9.0.0 were missing.

Below you'll find details on Ammo and Stats, but there are a handful of balance changes (Warlock, Titan, and more) with hopefully more details next week.

You may have seen some of this information on the D2Team accounts, but they are also collecting them here for anyone who wants to get caught up.

(MoSadie's note: As a reminder, these are not the full wording, for the full developer insights please read [the original TWID]({{ page.bungie_url }}))

### Portal and World Tabs

The World tab desaturation will be reverted in an upcoming update.

The intention going forward is for the Portal tab to serve as a quick access point to core game activities, and for the World tab to support exploration of the Destiny world. Both will continue to be updated.

### Bright Dust in The Edge of Fate

An infinite grind source for Bright Dust will be added, and paired with a make-good grant in an upcoming update.

### Power Deltas and Contest Raid

There are reports of enemies being at a higher Power Delta than expected in the Contest Raid. This is being investigated, and is a high priority for the team this week.

Each raid has been unique, especially at Contest difficulty. This will continue, but the feedback from this weekend will be used to inform future experiences.

Additionally, on reward quality. What tiers rewards within the raid are dropping at within Contest difficulty, and their Power in relations to yours. There are ways to increase the quality of rewards in Normal difficulty via raid feats.

Finally, investigations are beginning on an issue where rally banners are not refreshing ammo and abilities consistently. An update will be posted as soon as possible.

### Ability Regeneration in Armor 3.0

An issue has been discovered by the community where abilities were not regenerating as the rate communicated [in a previous TWID]({% post_url 2025-6-5-twid %}#what-do-the-new-stats-do). Previously it had been stated that 70 stats would be equivalent to certain pre-The Edge of Fate values and going above 70 would be faster. This isn't currently true for the 70 mark, but is for the 85 mark. This will be corrected in an upcoming update.

A full breakdown of how the stats are being corrected will be shared in the accompanying patch notes.

### Ammo Economy

The Weapons and Armor Sandbox team has been absorbing a lot of feedback this week around the ammo economy changes in The Edge of Fate.

(MoSadie's note: I'm cutting out a LOT of insights in this section, so please read [the original TWID]({{ page.bungie_url }}) for the full insights)

The mark was missed on some of the targets, and some changes will (and have been) made. In Update 9.0.0.3 a few adjustments have been made, and more are planned for the future.

In Update 9.0.0.3, players will see the following:

- Increased Rocket Sidearm ammo per ammo brick (5 -> 6 base, 12 -> 12 enhanced)
- Swords
    - Fixed a bug that was reducing their total ammo
    - This also increases their ammo per brick slightly
- Fixed some Area Denial Frames only getting one ammo per brick, now 3 base and 6 enhanced

The following changes are being playtested (aka subject to change) but most are being planned for Update 9.0.0.4 planned for July 29th:

- Players at the lowest end of ammo investment (0 stat, 0 mods), will see ammo progress faster providing more bricks
- Increase the ammo per brick for some additional weapon types.
- Buff the ammo generation stats for some Exotic weapons that are lagging behind so they generate ammo faster.

In the long run, the team also is planning:

- Provide a better method of highlighting ammo drops or recovering ammo if it falls off the map or into unreachable locations
- Improving how assists generate ammo for players
- Continue to build more sandbox combat hooks for generating ammo, enabling players to feel like they specialize in ammo generation, even for their teammates

## Prepare for Arms Week

As mentioned above, Arms Week is coming on July 29th. This is a week-long event focused on one weapon archetype. This first event will focus on Hand Cannons!

The first step into Arms Week is to visit Ada-1 **in the Shooting Range**. Ada-1 will give you a pursuit that kicks off the Arms Week event as well as the brand-new Solar Hand Cannon Phoneutria Fera (more details below!). By playing activities with Hand Cannons, you'll gather combat telemetry that allows Ada-1 to build more weapons and other rewards for you, including time-limited by *very* powerful Volatile Mods you can slot into the event's featured weapon archetype.

Don't forget to check out the Arms Week Event Home for daily and weekly challenges, as well as the Event Track of rewards!

### Weapons and More Weapons

In addition to the Phoneutria Fera, there are a few more weapons available to earn:

- A set of Legacy Hand Cannons
- Ribbontail, a new Strand Adaptive Trace Rifle (can roll with Proximity Power and Detonation Beam)

On top of that, there's the new Volatile Weapon Mods that will be earned through Arms Week. They are available for the duration of the event and can only be slotted into the featured weapon type, so put them on your Hand Cannons and wreak havoc!

- Chaos Munitions
    - Precision final blows produce randomized effects
- Cowboy Grip
    - Supremely improved hip-fire weapon performance
- Fragmentation Rounds
    - Precision final blows create multiple explosive submunitions

## Bungie Foundation Campaign Update

The full list of items can be found on the [known issues list](https://help.bungie.net/articles/27062192032404-Destiny-2-Year-7-Known-Issues-and-Vital-Information).

### Known Issues List

#### The Edge of Fate

- Some players can be blocked from launching Edge of Fate missions if error coded or leaving mid-way. A temporary workaround is to join a player who has access to the mission, and they launch into it.
- Matterspark is causing visual flickering on high field of view settings. Players experiencing this issue are advised to lower their game FOV. [View this guide for more tips.](https://help.bungie.net/articles/39425757480212-Matterspark-Guide)
- Not all players are earning the expected Exotic armor reward for completing the Edge of Fate Legendary campaign. Players should check the Altar of Relativity for their reward, in addition to replaying "The Invitation" and "Commencement" missions as there are separate known issues related to Legendary completion being incorrectly shown as in the "Legend Forged" triumph for these missions.
- Mythic Campaign missions are sometimes not granting players completion progress when other members of the fireteam are at different completion states.
- Players cannot attack in Matterspark if primary vehicle fire is not bound.
- Players can soft-lock themselves if reaching the Relocator in Exile's Accord too quickly.
- Some enemies do not suspend as expected on the Kepler destination.
- All players in a fireteam will see the fireteam leader's Ghost when receiving calls during the Edge of Fate.

#### Weapons and Armor

- The Adept Icarus mod can display as disabled.
- Certain Ammo Generation focused mods are not correctly appearing on all relevant weapons.
- Destabilizing Rounds can inconsistently grant Volatile Rounds.

- Remnants from Thorn do not spawn when Tangles appear after killing an enemy.
- Due to an issue, the Spirit of the Liar Exotic class item perk has been disabled.
- The description for the Mask of Bakris Hunter Exotic helmet does not accurately reflect a recent change where it can be activated with Stasis or Arc supers equipped, instead of only Stasis.
- The noble rounds fired from the Boots of the Assembler Exotic Warlock leg armor do not buff allies standing within the caster's rift.

#### Triumphs and Missions

- The Kepler Tasks triumph cannot be completed. Due to an issue, one of Ikora's Tasks will not be available until Update 9.0.0.4, at which time the missing quest and this triumph can be completed.
- Players who have acquired but not completed the Graviton Through the Ages Exotic quest may be blocked from completing the Commencement campaign mission on alternate characters until the Exotic quest has been completed.
- The Dark Academia quest cannot be completed until after players have completed The Outer Steppes Strangelet.
- An enemy in the Morphology mission has a placeholder name.

#### More

- Players can sometimes get stuck running at normal walk speed.
- Quitter Protection in the Competitive playlist is not working (Fireteam based protection is still working).
- Raid banners do not always function as expected.
- Some Exotic armor purchases from Xur do not grant progress toward a Favor of the Nine.
