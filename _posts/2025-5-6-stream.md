- Launches with The Edge of Fate on July 15th
- Will replace the Director button in orbit. (Director is still available)
- Designed to provide instance access to a range of activities.
- Buttons include:
    - Tower
    - Seasonal Hub
    - Latest Expansion
    - Solo Ops (1 player)
    - Fireteam Ops (1-3 players)
    - Pinnacle Ops (1-3 players)
    - Crucible Ops
- Each Ops button has both a list of specific activities and Quickplay options.
- Solo Ops also has Strikes, so now you can solo Strikes lol.

### Difficulty Customization

- You can choose from a list of premade options, or customize it to your liking.
- There are 50 all new modifiers being added to the game.

### PvP Power Grind

- PvP players can now earn all the power they need in PvP.

### Armor 3.0

As mentioned in a previous developer post, Armor 3.0 introduces set bonuses and a rework of the stats system. There are new stats, and bonuses for going over 100 in a stat!

In addition, all new gear has all its energy unlocked on drop.

That leads us into...

### Gear Tiers

- There are now 5 tiers of gear, both weapons and armor.
- Not sure exactly which tier, but confirmed that Tier 5 armor has _11_ energy.
- Tier depends on the difficulty of the activity you are doing.
- It's a cycle of get better gear -> do harder content -> get even better gear -> repeat.
- Tier 5 gear is also shaded differently, and has different kill effects. This can be toggled.

But where do you test this new gear?
