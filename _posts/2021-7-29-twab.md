TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we prepare for Cross Play!
- There are only *4* more TWABS before the August 24th event! (Including this one!)
- Solstice of Heroes ends next weekly reset! (That is August 3rd)
  - As a reminder, you need to complete the first two tiers of objectives before the event ends, the glows can be earned post-event.
- Cross Play is COMING!
  - Arriving in Season 15! (Exact date TBD)
  - Your Guardian's Identity:
    - For names to be consistant across platforms, Bungie Names are being introduced:
      - Exactly the same as Discord and Xbox with the `PlayerName#1234` style.
        - Will display in game as `PlayerName` using the example above.

    - Names with illegal characters will have those characters in their names removed (rip Guardian \[Hand Cannon\]\[Sniper Rifle\]\[Rocket Launcher\])
    - Names with offensive names will have their names replaced.
    - If a name is replaced or is empty, defaults to "Guardian\[Random Number\]".
      - Note: Name changes are not available at launch, so be careful!
