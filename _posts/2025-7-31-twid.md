TL;DR:

## Arms Week is On!

We are two days into Arms Week, which runs until weekly reset on Tuesday, August 5th. If you haven't started yet, visit Ada-1 in the Shooting Range to start the event. You can use the Combat Telemetry to buy Arms Week event weapon engrams, which can be opened at Rahool for free or focused at Ada-1 for higher tier rewards using Combat Telemetry.

*(MoSadie note: If you've been playing the event and felt like the reward pass was really slow, there was a bug preventing earning Event XP progress from completing Portal activities. [This has been fixed.](https://bsky.app/profile/destiny2team.bungie.net/post/3lvbqscnsjf2r))*

## The Coil Arrives at The Portal

The Portal has received a new activity this week: The Coil (from Season of the Wish during Lightfall)

## The Solstice Starts Next Week

Arms Week was the first event for The Edge of Fate, but Solstice is right around the corner! It will last two weeks from Tuesday, August 5th until Tuesday, August 19th.

![Solstice 2025 promo image](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt3408a0a759f883c3/688b1814161cd2503a1b51e9/Solstice_2025_16x9_With_Logo_EN.jpg)

Here is what you need to know:

### Goal

Use the Solstice Forge to create a full set of armor, then make it glow! (This will be a good chance to earn a few sets of new armor)

### What's changed?

Bonfire Bash is out, but a slew of new modifiers for Portal activities are in! These modifiers are inspired by Solar energy, and you might even recognize some of them from previous Artifacts.

As a teaser, here are just four of the modifiers: (You'll have to discover the rest yourself!)

- **Hot Potato**: Carriable Solar Flares occasionally drop from defeated combatants. Passing it between players increases the amount of damage it will do.
- **Fired Up**: Dealing damage and final blows from Solar sources raises a heat meter Once full, your weapons will cause Solar explosions.
- **Class Healing**: Heal yourself when using your class ability.
- **Igniter**: Precision hits against scorched combatants cause ignitions.

These modifiers will rotate on the matchmade Portal activities, but will always be accessible when customizing difficulty in non-matchmade Portal activities. With one exception: Hot Potato will always be enabled in the matchmade Portal activities.

In addition, a new Solstice Scorched Crucible Playlist will be available, featuring the Scorch Cannon. Games modes in the playlist include Clash, Control, and Rift.

Don't forget that weapons and armor in the Reward Shop can be up to Tier 4, depending on your Guardian Rank.

## Trials of Osiris is Back

Starting tomorrow, Trials of Osiris will return with Burnout as the map.

Only change to the mode itself is disabling the Power Level disadvantages.

There are no interruptions for the next 6 weeks, and there will be no featured weekly weapon. That means you can earn all of them. Next featured weapons will be September 9th, after Ash & Iron Major Update launches with two more weapons in the Trials loot pool.

### New Trials Rewards

- **Auric Disabler**: Strand - Precision Frame Auto Rifle
- **Aureus Neutralizer**: Kinetic - Spread Shot Hand Cannon
- **Aishaâ€™s Embrace**: Void - Rapid-Fire Frame Scout Rifle
- **Forgiveness:** Arc - Aggressive Frame Sidearm
- **Unwavering Duty**: Solar - Adaptive Machine Gun

## More Comms Support for The Edge of Fate

(MoSadie note: PLEASE make sure to read the [Original TWID]({{ page.bungie_url }}) all of the developer insights and apologies. I'm only listing the tangible changes here.)

### Missing Patch Notes

#### Solar

- Ember of Benevolence had its energy regen tuned during the stat rework. The amount of energy regen was reduced from 4x to 3x, and the duration of energy regen was increased by 1s.

#### Warlock

- Touch of Flame was tuned during the stat rework. The damage of Solar and Fusion grenades when enhanced by Touch of Flame was reduced by 10%.

#### Exotic Armor

- Warlock - Speaker's Sight
    - Turret's lifetime was reduced from 15s to 9s (Turret fires two less shots)
- Warlock - Wings of Sacred Dawn
    - No longer reloads your equipped weapon from reserves

#### Health vs. Shields

- Player Health
    - Player health stun (the time it takes the red part of the health bar to start regenerating) is equivalent to 100 of the old Recovery stat.
    - Player health regen is equivalent to 20 of the old Recovery stat.
        - The health stun and health regen tuning is intentional to get injured Guardians out of danger zone quickly, while leaving room for the Health stat and healing verbs to be valuable.
- Player Shields
    - Shield stun and shield regen is equivalent to 20 of the old Recovery stat while your Health stat is below 100.
    - When your Health stat increases from 100 to 200, your shield stun and shield regen will improve, eventually going beyond 100 of the old Recovery stat.
    - From 100 to 200, you will also gain additional shields when facing combatants.
        - There is an issue where the Health stat tooltip says this affects health and not shields. The tooltip text will be corrected in an upcoming update to properly note the benefit only increases shields.
    - Note that the 1-100 Health stat benefit of 'Healing Per Orb' increases the amount of health AND shields gained each time you pick up an Orb of Power.
        - We will also update the necessary tooltip texts in an upcoming update.

On a related note: Update 9.0.0.4 fixed an issue with the Health stat that was causing unexpected deaths, particularly in PvP. When this issue would occur, high Health stat values caused shield and health values to become desynchronized across the server, leading to players dying unexpectedly when they believed they had full health and shields.

### Currently Investigating

#### Warlock

- Player feedback that the sandbox for Warlock is being left behind other classes:
    - Buddy builds don't benefit much from the stat changes
    - There aren't many meta melee builds that benefit from the additive melee changes
    - And other feedback

A tuning pass is being investigated that will start with Ash & Iron and continue through Renegades.

#### Titan

- An interaction where Unbreakable on Prismatic Titan doesn't appear to work as intended with Shackle grenades.

#### Exotic Armor

The following is a non-exhaustive list of Exotic Armor that is being investigated based on issues and feedback:

- Contraverse Hold
- Crest of Alpha Lupi
- Nezarec's Sin
- Starfire Protocol
- Crown of Tempests
- Wings of Sacred Dawn
- Eunoia
- Geomag Stabilizers
- Boots of the Assembler
- Rime Coat Raiment

### Reported Issues

#### Warlock

- Handheld Supernova damage was reduced by 20%
    - This was not intended and will be fixed in a future update
- Sunbracers was turned during the grenade-stat rework to function the same at 70 stat
    - Due to the stats threshold issue, fewer grenades than intended were available at 70 stat.
    - This should be corrected with the Grenade stat fix in Update 9.0.0.4

#### Titan

- Throwing Hammer melee had a cooldown added to picking up the hammer and its bounce was increased vs. bosses.
    - This was not intended and will be fixed in Update 9.0.0.5

#### Stats

- Grenade, Melee, Super, and Class were not regenerating as we presented them pre-The Edge of Fate.
    - These were fixed in Update 9.0.0.4.
- The Weapon Stat will still display a 6% PVP buff after Update 9.0.0.4 despite being only 5%.
    - This will be fixed in a future update.

#### Hit Markers

- Hit markers don't appear in the HUD when players deal damage.
    - This was fixed in Update 9.0.0.4.

#### Weapons

- Queenbreaker no longer blinding on shots.
- Choir of One can be macroed to fire faster than intended.
    - This was fixed in Update 9.0.0.4.
- Choir of One has lower ammo regeneration than intended.
    - This was fixed in Update 9.0.0.4.
- Icebreaker swaps can provide ammo.
    - We're looking to fix this in the long-run but will let it ride for now.
- Certain Exotic Bows don't interact with Hierarchy of Needs Guidance Ring and the behavior for projectile tracking has changed.

#### Sprint

- We are investigating reports that players will sometimes sprint but not gain the accompanying increase in movement speed.
- To work around this issue if you encounter it, return to orbit and re-enter your activity.

For more technical details, check out the [Sprint Bug](#sprint-bug) section below.

#### Artifact Bonus

- Applying new gear ornaments can increase the damage resistance the player receives.
    - This will be fixed in the future

### The Desert Perpetual Investigation

Reports of cheating by some fireteams who cleared The Desert Perpetual Contest mode are being investigated. Cheating to complete Contest difficulty or other activities is a bannable offense, and players benefiting from cheating can also be subject to punishment.

### Raid and Dungeon Difficulty Scaling

The following changes are being planned for future updates:

- Updating the difficulty for Legacy raid and dungeon activities to address player feedback
    - The combat difficulty for normal and master modes will be reduced by 10 Power.
- Updating difficulty for The Desert Perpetual to address player feedback
    - Base combatant difficulty will be reduced by 10 Power.
    - The Cutthroat Combat raid feat combat difficulty will be lowered by 10 Power. (+40 -> +30)
    - The Combined Master Triumph will have requirements reduced to only require a single completion at base difficulty. Will still reward a +1 to reward tier based on number of feats active.

### Sprint Bug

The cause of this issue is players hitting a max number of stat modifiers allowing in a match or activity. This max number is shared among all players and enemies and normally would be rare to reach, but the modifiers aren't disappearing on death like they should. This means that they've been stacking when a player revives, increasing the likelihood that the max will be hit. Some players have pointed out, that this issue has existed since Episode: Heresy, but it is more common since The Edge of Fate's launch due to the additional Armor 3.0 stat modifiers.

A short-term fix is being targeted for Update 9.0.0.5 releasing on Tuesday, August 5th. This issue may still occur, but it should reduce in frequency as a long-term fix is being investigated.

## Bungie Foundation Campaign Wrap-Up

The Bungie Day campaigns are closed, and Guardians raised a total of $1,486,411! Great job everyone!

## Player Support Report

### Known Issues List

#### General

- Investigations continue into issues where some game functions will degrade over the course of an activity.
- Raid banners do not always function as expected.
- Enemies with Banes may have odd visual effects for some players.
- When unavailable, the Vanguard Armory armor rewards incorrectly state that players have already claimed their rewards for the week even if they have not.

#### Kepler

- Players who join another player during the Saturnism mission after that player has acquired the Relocator II upgrade are unable to acquire it themselves.
- Not all players are earning the expected Exotic armor reward for completing the Edge of Fate Legendary campaign.
