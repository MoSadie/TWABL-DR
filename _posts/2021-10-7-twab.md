TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, preparations for the Festival of the Lost begin!
- In-game, we had:
    - Teatime with Savathûn
    - Trails to trek in the Shattered Realm
    - Astrals to align in Astral Alignment.
    - Fikrul and his hoard of mini-Screebs tormented Guardians in the first Grandmaster Nightfall of the Season.
- We also had an update on the Destiny Content Vault. The TL;DR can be found [here]({% post_url 2021-10-7-DCV %}).
- Next week:
    - Some challenges can be embraced in the Shattered Realm. It's dangerous to go alone, take a friend.
    - Festival of the Lost begins! More details when it goes live!
- Festival of the Lost Preview: The Calavera Ghost Shell
    - TL;DR note: This section in the TWAB contains an interview with the artist who designed the Ghost Shell. I highly recommend checking it out [here](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50764)

- What's in the Patch Notes?
    - Alongside Festival of the Lost, Update 3.3.1 goes live on Tuesday. Below are some of the changes.
    - Grandmaster Nightfalls:
        - Platinum Grandmaster Nightfalls will now have a 100% chance of dropping an Adept Nightfall weapon.
    - The Corrupted Strike:
        - The "Sedia's Durance" activity modifier has been reduced from +40% knockback to +20% knockback.
        - Removed an Unstoppable Phalanx Champion from the Ransack Ogre encounter. (The part with the two Ogres you flip between.)
            - This Champion would spawn in the Ascendant Plane when the Ogre hit 50% health.
            - You could easily miss the Champion and kill the boss.
            - Which locks you out of the Ascendant Plane. So no backtracking.
            - After this Champion single handedly ruined hundreds of Platinum completion attempts, we've snapped it out of existence.
            - It's gone.
            - Dust.
            - Destroyed.
            - It will _never_ see the light of day again.
            - That's what it deserves.
        - Fixed an issue that blocked completion of The Corrupted Nightfall scoring Triumph.
    - Cross Play UI:
        - Updated the sign-on experience to show a single toast after character select if you have one or more pending Bungie Friend Requests, instead of one per request.
            - Receiving a Bungie Friend request while in-game has not been changed.
            - Known Issue: The toast may be blank. The requests are not affected.
        - Player search UI now has audio feedback.
        - Fixed a bug where the text chat auto-hide setting would revert itself under various conditions.
        - Fixed a bug where booting a fireteam member sometimes left a blank entry in the roster or fireteam UI.
        - Fixed a bug where online roster contacts were not sorting alphabetically for friends and clanmates.
        - Fixed a bug where blocking a player through a fireteam invite did not hide interaction options that are expected to fail when interacting with a blocked player.
    - Full Patch Notes on Tuesday, October 12th at 10 AM Pacific.
- Speaking of a Patch... (Support Section)
    - Update 3.3.1 goes live Tuesday, October 12th. Here's the update timeline:
        - 9:00 AM Pacific: Maintenance begins.
        - 9:45 AM Pacific: Players are removed from activities. Destiny 2 is brought offline.
        - 10:00 AM Pacific: Update 3.3.1 is made available. Players can log back into Destiny 2.
        - 11:00 AM Pacific: Maintenance is expected to conclude.
    - Here are some of the expected fixes in Update 3.3.1:
        - Horror's Least will no longer drop from the Corrupted Nightfall at zero power.
        - The Bombardiers Exotic Hunter leg’s bomb detonations now deal damage to active Supers.
        - Crashes will no longer be caused by opening the Appearance Customization screen with faction armor equipped.
        - The Tether Time Nightfall Triumph can now be earned as intended.
        - The Corrupted Nightfall Triumph for reaching a score of 100,000 is now rewarded as intended.
        - The Wayfinder Compass's inventory will now rotate with the daily reset.
    - (Relevant) Known Issues:
        - If players abandon Wayfinder's Voyage on step 19/53, they are unable to complete it when they reacquire it.
        - Players may have to wait in the H.E.L.M. for a long period of times for lore to unlock after listening to radio messages.
        - Step 42 of 53 for the Wayfinder's Voyage quest tells some players in non-English regions to purchase the wrong unlock in the Wayfinder's Compass. Players should purchase the Astral Attunement upgrade to advance this quest step, which is located on the bottom row on the far-right of the screen.
        - We’re aware of player reports claiming that Nothing Manacles isn’t working as intended. This is under investigation.
        - Focusing certain attributes may not work if certain Ghost attribute mods are equipped.
        - Only four daily bounties appear in Spider's inventory but the quest step during the Forsaken campaign requires five bounties.
- Author's Note:
    - The week's almost over.
    - Looking forward to Trials this weekend on \[REDACTED\].
    - Hoping for a good roll on \[REDACTED\] with \[REDACTED\] and \[REDACTED\] on it.
    - Cheers, ~~dmg04~~\[REDACTED\]
