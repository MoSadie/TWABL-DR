    - Rusted Lands: Bring Back the Booms:
        - Fixed an issue where dynamic objects, like barrels or bricks with physics and Hive exploding objects, were missing from this map.
    - The Corrupted: General Strike Fixes:
        - To reduce the overall length of the strike and make it less painful after hard wipes in the elevator encounter, we have removed the Taken combatants in the dark Ascendant Plane hallway leading up to the elevator.
        - If a fireteam hard wipes during the final phase of the boss fight in the Ascendant Realm, when they respawn the portal to the Ascendant Realm will take them straight to Phase 2, instead of making them replay the platforming section between Phase 1 and Phase 2.
        - When a fireteam arrives at the platforming area before the boss fight in The Adytum, any fireteam members or Ghosts left behind in earlier parts of the strike will now be teleported forward to join their fireteam.
        - When players begin the elevator encounter, any straggler players or their Ghosts will be pulled forward to join their fireteam.
        - Fixed an issue where Sedia's shields would regenerate faster than expected on Nightfall difficulties. Her shields now regenerate based on health threshold in Nightfalls, just like they do in Direct Launch or the Vanguard Playlist.
        - The portal to the Ascendant Realm after Phase 1 of the boss fight should now reliably place players facing the correct direction.
        - Fixed an issue that was preventing the combatants from walking to part of the right-side area during the first half of the boss-fight. Psions should now spread out a little bit more on that right platform.
        - Fixed an issue where a Taken Acolytes was spawning and immediately falling to its death during the floating platform area before the boss fight.
        - Fixed an issue where, in certain conditions, the relic would de-spawn and never respawn during the boss phase.
        - Fixed a cosmetic issue where the relic spawners during the boss would spin before the relic was spawned.
    - Dunemarchers:
        - Once a player is hit by a Dunemarchers lightning chain, they cannot be hit again by Dunemarchers for 2s.
        - Dunemarchers lightning now only chains on targets that are alive.
    - Icefall Mantle:
        - Stasis overshield can now be cancelled by pressing the class-ability input once more.
- Cross Play: Text Chat Check-In:
    - Displaying text chat will release with 30th Anniversary Pack on December 7th.
    - USB Keyboard support for console text chat will launch with The Witch Queen.
- Twitch Bounty Emblem Update:
    - New Gift Emblem starting December 16th.
    - ![emblem 3](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/154/154838/NewTwitchEmblem.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=1186589828)

        - Forsaken Ciphers don't appear in a player's loot steam if players already own Forsaken. Players can pick their Forsaken Ciphers up at the Monument to Lost Lights Exotic Archive in the Tower. Make sure you have space in your Consumables inventory for it.
        - Moments of Triumph: One Triumph states that one Lost Sector on Master Difficulty needs to be completed, but it's actually four.
    - Destiny 2 Leaving Xbox Game Pass for Consoles:
        - Destiny 2 is leaving Xbox Game Pass _for Console_ on December 8th. It will remain on Xbox Game Pass _for PC_.
        - Once Destiny 2 leaves, players who do not own the expansions will lose access to:

            - Stasis Subclass (Beyond Light-specific)
            - Middle-tree Supers for each subclass. (Owning any major expansion will unlock these)
            - 10% off Silver and other game add-ons.
        - Items such as Exotics and Season Passes will remain acquired and active.
