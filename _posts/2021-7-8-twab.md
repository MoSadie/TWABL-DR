TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we set a date.
- **On August 24th there will be a showcase for the future of Destiny 2.**

- Also Update 3.2.1 went out with Solstice of Heroes and Master Vault of Glass going live.
- Special Day:
  - Yesterday was Bungie Day!
  - TL;DR for Bungie Day announcements can be found [here](https://mosadie.github.io/TWABL-DR/tldr/2021/07/07/bungie-day-2021.html)
  - Also a new Community Art Series has gone live on the Bungie Store.
  - Two new wallpapers are also available to download. Links in the original Bungie.net article.
- It's a Bungie-ful day in the neighborhood. (Support Section)
  - Triumph Re-redeems:
    - With Update 3.2.1, a fix that was implemented meant that players need to re-redeem all of their Season 13 and 14 Triumphs.
    - Catalyst Competitor and One Fell Strike triumphs are bugged and may not be able to be re-redeemed, they're investigating.
  - Token Turn In:
    - With the launch of Season 15 on August 24th, Vanguard reputation ranks will no longer use Vanguard Tokens.
    - As a result, **VANGUARD TOKENS WILL BE DEPRECATED WHEN SEASON 15 LAUNCHES**.
    - Turn in _before August 24th_ in order to receive rewards for your tokens.
  - (Relevant) Known Issues:
    - We are currently investigating reports of Solstice Key Fragments and Solstice packages being removed from player inventories.
    - Prismatic Orbs do not contribute to total Elemental Orbs collected by players.
    - The Light and Dark Weekly Solstice bounty for Gambit will only gain progress from elemental final blows on Guardians.
    - Players are receiving the Plug One.1 Fusion Rifle instead of the Uzume RR4 Sniper Rifle as a Nightfall completion reward.
    - The Unstoppable Schwarzschild Condensor mod costs 5,000 Glimmer to apply instead of the usual 500.
    - The Prismatic Taken event UI may overlap other objective UI when players have multiple buffs active.
    - The Repeatable Solstice Bounties do not display their Bright Dust reward when viewed in Eva’s inventory. Completing these Repeatable Bounties will still award ten Bright Dust each.
    - Renewed Solstice armor displays the Season of the Splicer icon instead of the Solstice icon.
    - The Baby Fallen emote will appear at the very end of player emote inventories.
    - Subtitles do not appear during new {% include spoiler.html text="Mithrax" %} announcement dialogues.
    - Subtitles do not appear when interacting with {% include spoiler.html text="the House of Light banner in the Eliksni Quarter" %}.
    - The Ludomaniacal emblem does not unlock after players reset their Infamy rank three times. Player may be able to get around this by claiming an Exotic engram from Drifter’s inventory.
- Author's Note:
  - Short week + Bungie Day makes for a short TWAB.
  - More to talk about over the next few months.
  - Information on exactly what time the showcase is is coming soon, but most likely morning Pacific time.
