It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions this month so far, but we have been loving every second of the art, memes, and discussions inspired by what’s new. Keep in mind throughout your adventures that there are a lot of New Lights coming in to see what all the hype is about, let’s help them out and show them the true heart of the Destiny 2 community. 

Before we let you go, I did want to highlight one more thing from the Bungie team. Bungie has previously spoken up about the invasion of Ukraine, and to help beyond just words, we have dedicated the proceeds from the first 48 hours of our recent Game2Give charity stream to humanitarian efforts. For those interested in learning more, you can read about what steps are being taken here. 

In a blog post published this week (found here), you will see various organizations that are lending help to those that need it. We also shared a first look at the new emblem (pictured below) so that players can use to show support in-game, as well. It’s a completely free way to show our solidarity with players from the affected areas so that they know they are not alone. 

“For “Cоняшник,” we humbly tried to exemplify the hope and courage that has been so emblematic of the Ukrainian people during this impossible time. Alongside Ukraine’s coat of arms, impressionistic sunflowers, Ukraine’s national flower, populate the peaceful countryside – a metaphor for hope and our way of expressing solidarity.” 

To grab the free emblem, use this code: JVG-VNT-GGG

Until next time, stay kind and keep those new raid memes coming! 

"I should go,"
<3 Hippy
