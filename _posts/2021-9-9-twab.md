  - (Relevant) Known Issues:
    - We are investigating an increase in error code POTATO on PC. Players who have non-English characters as part of their installation folder name may be able to resolve this issue by replacing those characters with English characters.
    - The Proving Grounds strike icon doesn't appear on Nessus until players complete the Legacy: Challenger's Proving VII quest.
    - The Tether Time Nightfall triumph cannot be completed due to Lake of Shadows boss not tethering.
    - Settings for voice chat persist between Steam to consoles. Players must log into Steam to turn Voice chat to On or reset their audio to default options.
- Author's Note:
  - dmg will be getting married in a few days! (TL;DR note: CONGRATS DMG!)
  - As a result, dmg will be taking some time off.
  - Don't worry, we will have Cozmo and DPS helping out while dmg's gone.
  - Cheers, dmg04
