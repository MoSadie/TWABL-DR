TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, butt was kicked, names taken, grass made prettier, and players unbanned.
- Ritual, Vanguard, and Crucible - Oh My!
    - For Season 16, expected around double the Vanguard rep gain.
    - For Season 16, adding a small amount of Trials Rep per match per round won, up to 105 extra per match.
    - Oh look, a Trials weapon.
    - ![Trials Weapon](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/156/156116/thumbnail_Trials_Weapons.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=2259311299)
    - Gambit likely to change, but due to *Gambit changes in Season 16* they want to see how those play out first.
    - Feedback heard on activity streaks and the placement of ritual weapons. It's not meeting their design goals.
    - Also, when double loop/rep is occurring in an activity, there will be a modifier on the activity to let you know.
    - Vanguard Ops:
        - [As a reminder]({% post_url 2021-10-7-DCV %}), Battlegrounds (from Season 13) will be combined with Strikes to create the Vanguard Ops playlist.
        - These Battlegrounds will be the no-champion versions.
    - Nightfall:
        - Strike-specific modifiers will be removed.
        - New style of burn: Acute with 50% incoming damage increase and *25% damage output* of the specified element.
        - Season Strike modifiers will be moved from Vanguard playlist to Nightfalls.
            - For Season 16 these will be themed to the Glaive and Void.
            - Rotates weekly and appears on Hero, Legend, and Master Nightfalls.
        - Shields will now be indicated in a modifier when Match Game is in effect.
        - New Loot Teaser:
        - ![Nightfall Loot](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/156/156116/thumbnail_TWQ_Nightfall_Weapons.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=2259311299)
    - Lost Sector:
        - Legend and Master Lost Sectors will be the same location starting in Season 16. Choose difficulty in world. Exotic is the same across difficulty.
    - Crucible:
        - Longer respawn timer has been reverted.
- HDR Needs Love Too:
    - Windows 10 (and up): Windowed HDR support launches with The Witch Queen.
        - To use: in-game HDR settings must be enabled and "Use HDR" enabled for the specified display.
        - When in windowed HDR, will auto swap between SDR if the window moves to a non-HDR display.
        - All players (SDR or HDR) who use OBS's Window Capture must ensure the "Capture Method" is set to "Windows Graphics Capture" to not record a black screen. (Windows 10 and up only)
    - Windows 10 (and up): Windowed Fullscreen should provide the same (or better) performance compared to Exclusive Fullscreen.
    - Screenshots will now be supported while in HDR on PC.
        - Must use the in-game screenshot feature.
        - HDR screenshots will be tone mapped to SDR and saved as lossless PNG files.
    - Display Calibration Improvements (All Platforms)
        - New Calibration UI
        - SDR and HDR calibration settings are now saved per-platform instead of per-account. (Existing settings will be reset)
        - SDR brightness settings no longer affect HDR.
        - Xbox players will no longer be shown the SDR calibration when HDR is active.
