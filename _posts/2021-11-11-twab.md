TL;DR:
- This week at Bungie, we got guns over here.
- This week covers Trials Labs, weapon changes, fashion, more Bungie Bounties.
- But first...
- Be True:
    - Everyone at Bungie, both trans developers and allies alike, stand in support of our transgender and gender nonconforming community. We join the call to end anti-trans violence and discrimination.
    - Ahead of Transgender Awareness Week, which runs from November 13th through the 19th, Bungie is proud to announce their new trans pride emblem, "Be True"
    - It is available for free to everyone, use the code `ML3-FD4-ND9` on the [code redemption page](https://bungie.net/redeem).
    ![Be True Emblem](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/154/154561/Trans_Pride_Emblem_Announcement_C.png?cv=3983621215&av=3427562114)
    - In addition, all profits from the sale of [Bungie's Pride Pin](https://bungiestore.com/bungie-s-pride-collectible-pin) will benefit TransLifeline in support of their efforts to provide peer support to trans people in crisis through respectful, anonymous, and confidential communication and resources.
- Back to the Lab again:
    - This week's lab is Capture Zone.
    - Changes since last time:
        - 30 seconds after the round starts, a capture zone is enabled. Capture to win, or eliminate other team as normal.
        - Capture Zone Waypoint will appears from round start. Includes timer.
        - Capture Zone starts in middle of map and changes each round.
        - Different Map: Endless Vale
        - Instead of same points as Control, points are now at Temple, Mid, and Shrine.
        - No more Super energy from capturing zone.
    - As a reminder: 2x Trials Rank Booster all weekend, and Flawless Pool turns on Sunday at 10AM Pacific.
- Pew Pew:
    - With the 30th Anniversary content on December 7th, there are some weapon balancing changes.
    - All reasoning can be found in the [TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50820).

            - Removed the multi-hit requirement. (dealing any damage gives buff)
            - Increased the buff to reload stat from +50 -> +70. (reload is slow if you miss, but quicker than pre-nerf if buffed)
            - Increased buff duration to 7 seconds.
        - Arbalest:
            - Now has intrinsic anti-barrier.

        - When Warlock’s perform a Phoenix Dive, they can't slide for 5 seconds.
        - The Wicked Overgrowth shader isn’t available for players who completed the Iron Banner quest on all their characters before our fix went out to correct the issue.
- Author's Note:
    - Well, that was a lot of information.
    - Not every TWAB leading up to the 30th Anniversary will have this much meat on the bone.
    - But, they will have gravy and stuffing.
    - See you soon.
