TL;DR:

## Edge of Fate Reveal Stream

Save the date! May 6th at 9am Pacific. (That is one hour before the weekly reset.)

They will reveal The Edge of Fate (formerly Codename: Apollo) and the upcoming year of Destiny 2.
Be ready.

## Something Taken, Something Earned

If you recall there was a bugged Rite of the Nine accidental launch which left Guardians with some... unusual loot. They tried to let Guardians keep their spoils, but they couldn't pull it off, so they will be removed from everyone.

BUT! As an apology, **ALL** players will receive 1500 currency on May 6th to spend with the Emissary for rewards. This is worth about _two_ dungeon _runs_ worth of loot.

## New Nightfall, New Emblem

Next week marks the Sunless Cell will be the featured Nightfall. (Fun fact: For the first time ever!)

To celebrate, anyone who completes a Sunless Cell Nightfall (ANY DIFFICULTY) during that week will earn the "Break Free" emblem. (picture in TWID, distribution will be later)

Also Palindrome is back for the 2nd time since it's reprisal.

## Trials Weapon

The new Keen Thistle Sniper Rifle is entering the pool this weekend. Don't forget Flawless is no longer required for Adepts.

- While speaking to a vendor you can hear their ambient dialog.
- Ionic Sentry sometimes doesn't Chain Lightning enemies.
- Steps 6 and 9 of the Drowning Labyrinth quest aren't able to be completed by some players. (Your research tier is last earned across your account, so if your main is Tier 2 and your alt char unlocks Tier 1, you're back to Tier 1 on all characters until the next Tier unlock)
- Sometimes in the Derealize Exotic mission, the Taken relic can drop below the surface during the Vhriisk encounter.
- When damaging Shrieker bosses in the Sundered Doctrine dungeon, players receive critical damage feedback, but damage is actually regular base damage.

- Secant Filaments and Spirit of the Filaments canâ€™t grant Devour while Facet of Protection is equipped.
